# Privacy Policy
The use of this application ("Bot") within a Discord server ("Server") requires the collection and processing of specific user and server data ("Data"). By using the Bot, you consent to the collection, use, and storage of your Data as described in this Policy.

## Access to Data
Access to Data is strictly limited to the Bot's developers and authorized personnel, and only to the extent necessary for the development, maintenance, testing, and operation of the Bot. Data will not be sold, shared, or disclosed to any third party, except as required by applicable law, regulations, or Discordâ€™s Terms of Service.
Users may request access to their stored Data by contacting @KillerBOSS2019 or @w74knight.

## Storage and Security of Data
Data is stored within a server-side SQLite database. Reasonable measures are taken to secure the database and prevent unauthorized access. However, no method of electronic storage is entirely secure, and as such, no guarantee can be made against potential breaches. The Bot owners assume no liability for unauthorized access to or disclosure of Data.

## Data Collected Automatically
SMILES.bot (#2045, ID 1347275416225976333) automatically collects and processes the following Data in order to deliver its features and ensure correct operation:

- Discord User ID
- Discord Username
- Guild ID (Server ID)
- Count of Messages Sent Within a Guild
- Message Content (processed in real-time for automation and command recognition; individual messages are not stored)

This Data is used exclusively for purposes such as customizing bot behavior per server, and responding to user interactions (e.g., commands, automated triggers).
Message content is processed in memory and not persistently stored unless explicitly required for a feature (e.g., logging, statistics). In cases where storage is necessary, it will be limited, justified, and disclosed to the server administrators.

## Retention of Data
Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. Users may request deletion of their Data by contacting the Bot developers directly.

## Questions and Contact Information
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or wish to inquire about the Data stored related to your account, please contact damienweifen@gmail.com.
For more information, please review the [Discord Terms Of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
